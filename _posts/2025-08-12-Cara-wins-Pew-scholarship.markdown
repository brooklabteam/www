The prestigious Pew Biomedical Scholars program announced the induction of 22 new faculty fellows today in its 2026 class. 
This national cohort included two Assistant Professors at UC Berkeley, one of whom was Cara. 
The Brook lab will use the support to design and implement anti-henipavirus vaccines in wild Madagascar fruit bats, with the aim to eradicate future zoonotic viruses in the wildlife population prior to human emergence.
