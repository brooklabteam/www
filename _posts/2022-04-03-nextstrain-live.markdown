Our [Nextstrain](https://nextstrain.org) community build for SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Madagascar is now live at the following [link](https://nextstrain.org/community/brooklabteam/ncov-Madagascar)! You can play with the build, experimenting with coloring the sequences by various metadata (e.g. country of origin, location, clade, date, etc) and watch videos of the spread of infection across the country in this auspice interface.
<br> 
Stay tuned for updates on our paper-in-progress and additions of more recent data!
