The Brook Lab is excited to announce that we have been awarded an <a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-20-259.html">NIH NIAID New Innovators Award (DP2)</a> for 'Crossing scales to predict and prevent bat viruses zoonoses in a Madagascar ecosystem.' This opportunity funds early stage investigators to embark on 'High Risk High Reward' projects outside the scope of more traditional funding mechanisms.

Over the next 5 years, we'll be working to (1) decipher the population-level transmission dynamics of potentially zoonotic henipaviruses, filoviruses, and coronaviruses in Madagascar fruit bats, (2) model the within-host energetic constraints that drive seasonal pulses in bat virus shedding, and (3) eradicate potentially zoonotic henipaviruses from Malagasy <i>Eidolon dupreanum</i> (see below) through application of a multivalent henipavirus vaccine.

We'll be collaborating with the lab of <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/aguilarlab/home">Dr. Hector Aguilar Carreno</a> at Cornell University to develop and deploy this vaccine.


Stay tuned for all the exciting work ahead!
