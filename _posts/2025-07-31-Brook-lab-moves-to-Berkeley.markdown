From July 9-11, 2025, the Brook lab hosted the **Fourth International Symposium on the Infectious Diseases of Bats (BatID 2025)** at the University of Chicago. 
<br />
Over 140 people attended, representing 9 countries and 24 states. Plenary Speakers [Dr. Liliana Davalos](https://lmdavalos.github.io) from Stony Brook University, [Dr. Benhur Lee](https://leelabvirus.host/about) from Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, [Dr. Daniel Streicker](https://streickerlab.com) from the University of Glasgow, [Dr. Simon Anthony](https://anthonylab.vetmed.ucdavis.edu) from UC Davis, and [Dr. Tigga Kingston](https://kingstonlab.org/people/tigga-kingston/) from Texas Tech University led off five fascinating sessions focused, 
respectively, on *'Bat immunology and within-host dynamics'*, *'Bat pathogen evolution'*, *'Bat pathogen persistence & transmission dynamics'*, *'Bat pathogen discovery'*, and *'Reconciling bat infectious diseases and conservation'*. 
<br />
I owe a huge thanks to co-organizers, [Dr. Arinjay Banerjee](https://banerjeelab.ca) from VIDO, University of Saskatchewan; [Dr. Hannah Frank](https://www.hkfrank.com) from Tulane University, [Dr. Stephanie Seifert](https://labs.wsu.edu/mezap/) from Washington State University; and [Dr. Daniel Becker](https://beckerlab.weebly.com) from the University of Oklahoma. With support from the [NSF IOS Division](https://www.nsf.gov/bio/ios), we were able to fund 17 students to attend with travel awards from all over the world. Please see the [meeting webpage](https://brooklab.org/programs/bat-id-2025) for more information. We look forward to the next BatID, to be held tentatively in the summer of 2027.
