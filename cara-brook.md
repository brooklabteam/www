I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Ecology and Evolution](https://ecologyandevolution.uchicago.edu/) at the University of Chicago and a [Branco Weiss ‘Society in Science’ Fellow](https://brancoweissfellowship.org/). I investigate the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of zoonotic infections, in particular those derived from wild bat hosts. I maintain a longterm field site studying fruit bat viruses on  the island nation of Madagascar, where I work closely with students from the University of Antananarivo and Institut Pasteur de Madagascar. I am committed to conducting rigorous science while simultaneously promoting scientific development, education, and capacity building in Madagascar. 

Prior to the University of Chicago, I spent time as a [Miller Postdoctoral Fellow](http://miller.berkeley.edu/) working with [Mike Boots](https://bootslab.org/) in the Department of Integrative Biology at the University of California, Berkeley. I received my PhD in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology from Princeton University in 2017 and my BS in Earth Systems from Stanford University in 2010. I hail originally from beautiful Sonoma County, California. When not chasing bat viruses, you will find me hiking, backpacking, and camping across the North American West.
