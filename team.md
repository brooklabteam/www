**Katie Young** is a **Postdoctoral Scholar** in the Department of Ecology and Evolution at the University of Chicago. She will be using an inter-disciplinary approach including field-based sampling, metagenomic sequencing, and open-source data to better understand the complex host-vector-environmental interactions that drive viral emergence in Madagascar. Katie holds a Master’s degree and Ph.D. from New Mexico State University where she studied the ecology and evolution of arthropod-borne viruses. She was awarded a Fulbright Fellowship in 2016 to research the impact of oil palm insertion into native Bornean forests on the risk of spillover of dengue viruses from non-human primates to humans. Prior to joining the Brook Lab, Katie was a USDA-ARS funded postdoctoral fellow studying the ecological drivers of vesicular stomatitis virus emergence from Southern Mexico into the US and supported the development of an early warning system using Big-Data-Model-Integration approaches.
