*Ekipa Fanihy* means 'Team Fruit Bat' in Malagasy. We are a collection of hard-working students and research staff investigating infection dynamics in three species of Madagascar fruit bat (*Pteropus rufus*, *Eidolon dupreanum*, and *Rousettus madagascariensis*). In an effort to build the longitudinal dataset needed to answer our research questions, we collect monthly biological samples from wild populations of the three Malagasy fruit bat species at several remote Madagascar field sites, then conduct molecular and serological assays on these samples to determine infection and immune status in the laboratory. Visit our [Blogsite](/news) to follow our progress in the field!

**Angelo Andrianiaina** is a **PhD student** in the Department of Zoology and Animal Biodiversity at the University of Antananarivo, Madagascar, where he studies seasonal variation in ectoparasite infestation of two Malagasy fruit bats (*Eidolon dupreanum* and *Rousettus madagascariensis*) and the impacts of this variation on the dynamics of infection for vector-borne pathogens, such as *Bartonella* spp. Angelo holds a Master's degree in Animal Conservation from the University of Antananarivo and has previously worked on projects promoting lemur conservation in vanilla plantations in northern Madagascar, as well as projects documenting small mammal and herpetological biodiversity in the Moramanga District of east-central Madagascar.

**Anecia Gentles** is our senior **Field Project Manager** for Ekipa Fanihy. Anecia joined our team in January 2019 and has been with us through two field seasons. She works closely with Sami Kreling and Katie Fitzgerald to organize and lead monthly field collections on our project. In addition to field work, Anecia is currently reviewing previous modeling studies of bat infection dynamics and plans to apply to PhD programs in disease ecology in fall 2019. Anecia graduated with a Bachelor's of Science in Ecology from Rice University in 2018.

**Sarah Guth** is a third-year **PhD Candidate** in the Department of Integrative Biology at the University of California, Berkeley. Sarah is advised by [Professor Mike Boots](https://bootslab.org/) and studies the evolutionary underpinnings of cross-species zoonotic emergence. Sarah is carrying out a subset of dissertation chapters in part with Ekipa Fanihy, specifically investigating seasonal variation in inter-species contact rates, as well seasonal viral pulsing of potentially zoonotic viruses shed in bat excretia. Sarah holds a Bachelor of Arts degree in Conservation Biology from Middlebury College and has previously studied foraging and learning behavior in bees, as well as served as the Program Coordinator for Harvard University's [Planetary Health Alliance](https://planetaryhealthalliance.org/).

**Christian Ranaivoson** is just finishing his **PhD** in the Department of Zoology and Animal Biodiversity at the University of Antananarivo, Madagascar, and has already started his appointment as a **postdoctoral researcher** in the Virology Unit at Institut Pasteur de Madagascar. Christian's PhD research focused on the distribution and transmission of intra-erythrocytic parasites of Malagasy fruit bats, specifically *Babesia* spp. infections of the Madagascan flying fox, *Pteropus rufus,* and *Bartonella* spp. infections of the Madagascan fruit bat, *Eidolon dupreanum.* As a postdoc, Christian will lead Next Generation Sequencing studies with targeting viral discovery in Malagasy fruit bats. Christian holds a Master's degree in Biology, Ecology, and Animal Conservation from the University of Antananarivo and has previously studied infections of Malagasy crayfishes and nematode parsites of Malagasy reptiles.
