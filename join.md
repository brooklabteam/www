<h2>A note on diversity and inclusion</h2>

<img src="/assets/join/brook_lab_ranomafana.jpeg" alt="ranomafana" class="float-start col-sm-5" />

We are an equal-opportunity group, committed to enacting anti-racist and anti-sexist policies to promote inclusivity in our lab, the biological sciences, and the academy. We believe that black lives matter, women's rights are human rights, and no life is illegal. Applicants from underrepresented backgrounds, ethnicities, genders, sexual orientations, and lifestyles are enthusiastically encouraged to apply to any of the positions outlined below.

**As a result of our NIH DP2 award, we are currently eligible to apply for an [NIH Research Supplement to Promote Diversity in Health-Related Research](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PA-23-189.html). These supplements can support individuals at the high school, post-bacc, graduate, or postdoc level. If you are interested in joining the lab and believe you might be eligible for one of these supplements, please reach out to [Cara Brook](mailto:cbrook@berkeley.edu) directly.**

<h2>PhD Positions</h2>

**I am recruiting one PhD student to join my group in fall 2026 (fall 2025 application cycle).**  In general, my lab attracts motivated students with broad interests in disease ecology, conservation biology, and/or epidemiology who are eager to undertake a multi-faceted PhD involving some combination of field study, molecular work, and dynamical modeling. 
For recruits to start in AY2026-2027, I am particularly interested in a field-capable graduate student with a strong interest and/or background in international research and a desire to spend extensive amounts of time in Madagascar. I am also interested in students with strong wet lab skills in molecular detection of viruses in biological samples (PCR + NGS) or serological detection of antibodies in field-collected serum. Finally, I am always interested in students with a background or interest in building and fitting dynamical, mechanistic transmission models to infectious disease data and/or matrix population models to abundance data. 

**If you are interested in joining the Brook Lab in AY2026-2027, I ask that you please fill out an expression of interest and upload a short CV or resumÃ© at the form [linked here](https://airtable.com/app7Txy3E64J0EIXn/pagGnBXYIg1W1JEmo/form) prior to midnight on Friday, October 17, 2025**.

Please do not feel pressure to spend exorbitant amounts of time on this submission--it is not intended to be an intimidating application! I am simply trying to make the graduate admissions process as fair and transparent as possible, and I believe that considering applicants in one, consolidated block will support this goal.

Please see the [UC Berkeley Department of Integrative Biology](https://ib.berkeley.edu/) for details on graduate applications.

<h2>Postdocs</h2>

**All funded postdoc positions in my lab are full at this time.** However, independent postdoctoral fellows are always welcome, and I am happy to advise any interested individuals on related fellowship or grant applications. I have previous experience as both a [Miller Fellow](https://miller.berkeley.edu/) and a [Branco Weiss Fellow](https://brancoweissfellowship.org/) myself and would be delighted to help strategize an application. UC Berkeley offers a range of fellowship opportunities; please feel free to reach out at [cbrook@berkeley.edu](mailto:cbrook@berkeley.edu) if you are interested in developing a fellowship application to join the group.

<h2>Undergraduates</h2>

We have several UC Berkeley undergraduate researchers in the lab at any given time and many small projects available for an interested student. As a policy, I do not allow undergrads to intern without pay, a practice that has been shown to exacerbate inequities in opportunity and access. We do not currently have any specific positions available at this time; however, UC Berkeley abounds with opportunities for proactive undergrads to acquire funding to carry out mentored research.

Undergraduates wishing to conduct summer research should explore funding opportunities through [URAP](https://research.berkeley.edu/urap/), [SURF](https://research.berkeley.edu/surf/), and [Rose Hills](https://research.berkeley.edu/rose-hills-program/) programs at UC Berkeley. 

If you are an undergrad with an interest in applying for one of these opportunities to conduct research in the lab, please email me at [cbrook@berkeley.edu](mailto:cbrook@berkeley.edu) to set up a meeting to discuss! The earlier you reach out prior to these deadlines, the better.

<h2>Field Technicians</h2>

We typically employ two **Field Technicians** in one-year positions based in Madagascar. These technicians work with [Association Ekipa Fanihy](https://ekipafanihy.org) to undertake bat capture and collection of biological samples for our longterm project, as well as rudimentary laboratory processing. These positions are targeted towards American post-baccalaureate students eager to work with Malagasy PhD students on [Ekipa Fanihy](/team). I have found this to be a rewarding experience for both American and Malagasy students in the past, allowing both parties to engage in scientific and cultural exchange.

We just closed applications for another one-year Ekipa Fanihy Field Technician position, with a planned start date in May 2025. Please see the [field technician](/join/field-technician) page for a description of the job postin. We will likely search again in September 2025 for a new technician to start in January 2026. Please contact Cara Brook at [cbrook@berkeley.edu](mailto:cbrook@berkeley.edu) with any questions.
