<h2>PhD Positions</h2>

I recently started as an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Ecology and Evolution](https://ecologyandevolution.uchicago.edu/) at the University of Chicago. **I am recruiting new graduate students to join my lab in fall 2023!** I'm looking for motivated students with broad interests in disease ecology, conservation biology, and/or epidemiology who are eager to undertake a multi-faceted PhD involving some combination of field study, molecular work, and dynamical modeling. 

For recruits to start in AY2023-2024, I am particularly interested in students with a strong interest and/or background in international field work and a desire to spend extensive amounts of time in Madagascar. I am also interested in students with a background or interest in building and fitting dynamical, mechanistic transmission models to infectious disease data and/or matrix population models to abundance data. If either or both of these topics sounds like you, please reach out!

**If you are interested in joining the Brook Lab, I ask that you please fill out an expression of interest and upload a short CV or resum√© at the form [linked here](https://airtable.com/shrbNU7XV2wIHFZtK) prior to midnight on October 14, 2022**. 

Please do not feel pressure to spend exorbitant amounts of time on this submission--it is not intended to be an intimidating application! I am simply trying to make the graduate admissions process as fair and transparent as possible, and I believe that considering applicants in one, consolidated block will support this goal.

Formal applications are due to the [University of Chicago Division of Biological Sciences](https://biosciences.uchicago.edu/programs) on December 1, 2022.

<h2>Postdocs</h2>

**All funded postdoc positions in my lab are full at this time.** However, independent postdoctoral fellows are always welcome, and I am happy to advise any interested individuals on related fellowship or grant applications. I have previous experience as both a [Miller Fellow](http://miller.berkeley.edu/) and a [Branco Weiss Fellow](https://brancoweissfellowship.org/) myself and would be delighted to help strategize an application. The [University of Chicago Fellows](https://biologicalsciences.uchicago.edu/research/chicago-fellows) program in the Biological Sciences (applications due annually in December) is one exciting opportunity specific to our university. Please feel free to reach out at [cbrook@uchicago.edu](cbrook@uchicago.edu) if you are interested in developing a fellowship application to join the group.

<h2>Field Technicians</h2>

We recently solicited applications for a new **Field Technician** for the upcoming 2022-2023 year. Applications are now closed and will not renew again until the fall. For future opportunities, please note that this job is targeted towards American post-baccalaureate students eager to work with Malagasy PhD students on [Ekipa Fanihy](/team) to catch and collect samples from wild fruit bats in Madagascar. I have found this to be a rewarding experience for both American and Malagasy students in the past, allowing both parties to engage in scientific and cultural exchange. Please see [here](/join/field-tech) for a job description of past opportunities. We will likely solicit applications again in September for a January 2023 start.
