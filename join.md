<h2>PhD Positions</h2>

I recently started as an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Ecology and Evolution](https://ecologyandevolution.uchicago.edu/) at the University of Chicago. **I am recruiting new graduate students to join my lab in fall 2022!** I'm looking for motivated students with broad interests in disease ecology, conservation biology, and/or epidemiology who are eager to undertake a multi-faceted PhD involving some combination of field study, molecular work, and dynamical modeling. For recruits to start in AY2023-2024, I am particularly interested in students with a strong interest and/or background in international field work and a desire to spend extensive amounts of time in Madagascar.

**If you are interested in joining the Brook Lab, I asked that you please fill out an expression of interest and upload a short CV or resumé at the form [linked here](https://airtable.com/shrbNU7XV2wIHFZtK) prior to midnight on October 15, 2022**. 

Please do not feel pressure to spend exorbitant amounts of time on this submission--it is not intended to be an intimidating application! I am simply trying to make the graduate admissions process as fair and transparent as possible, and I believe that considering applicants in one, consolidated block will support this goal.

Formal applications are due to the [University of Chicago Division of Biological Sciences](https://biosciences.uchicago.edu/programs) on December 1, 2022.

<h2>Postdocs</h2>

**All funded postdoc positions in my lab are full at this time.** However, independent postdoctoral fellows are always welcome, and I am happy to advise any interested individuals on related fellowship or grant applications. I have previous experience as both a [Miller Fellow](http://miller.berkeley.edu/) and a [Branco Weiss Fellow](https://brancoweissfellowship.org/) myself and would be delighted to help strategize an application. The [University of Chicago Fellows](https://biologicalsciences.uchicago.edu/research/chicago-fellows) program in the Biological Sciences (applications due annually in December) is one exciting opportunity specific to our university. Please feel free to reach out at [cbrook@uchicago.edu](cbrook@uchicago.edu) if you are interested in developing a fellowship application to join the group.

<h2>Field Technicians</h2>

We are hiring a new **Field Technician** for the upcoming 2022-2023 year! This job is targeted towards American post-baccalaureate students eager to work with Malagasy PhD students on [Ekipa Fanihy](/team)) to catch and collect samples from wild fruit bats in Madagascar. I have found this to be a rewarding experience for both American and Malagasy students in the past, allowing both parties to engage in scientific and cultural exchange. 

Applications for our current position are due on April 29, 2022. Please see [here](/jointhelab/fieldtechjob) for a job description and a link to an application!
