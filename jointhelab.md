<h2>A note on diversity and inclusion</h2>

<img src="/jointhelab/ekipa_fanihy_happy.jpg" alt="bat" class="img-left-w-text" />

We are an equal-opportunity group, committed to enacting anti-racist and anti-sexist policies to promote inclusivity in our lab, the biological sciences, and the academy. We believe that black lives matter, women's rights are human rights, and no life is illegal. Applicants from underrepresented backgrounds, ethnicities, genders, sexual orientations, and lifestyles are enthusiastically encouraged to apply to any of the positions outlined below.

<h2>PhD Positions</h2>

I recently started as an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Ecology and Evolution](https://ecologyandevolution.uchicago.edu/) at the University of Chicago. **I am recruiting new graduate students to join my lab in fall 2022!** I'm looking for motivated students with broad interests in disease ecology, conservation biology, and/or epidemiology who are eager to undertake a multi-faceted PhD involving some combination of field study, molecular work, and dynamical modeling. 

<br />

**If you are interested in joining the Brook Lab, I asked that you please fill out an expression of interest and upload a short CV or resumé at the form [linked here](https://airtable.com/shrwbDz0QWBo0SMnQ) prior to midnight on October 31, 2021**. If you are just seeing this posting for the first time, you can still submit materials, but please drop me an email to notify me of your submission.

<br />

Please do not feel pressure to spend exorbitant amounts of time on this submission--it is not intended to be an intimidating application! I am simply trying to make the graduate admissions process as fair and transparent as possible, and I believe that considering applicants in one, consolidated block will support this goal.

<br />

Formal applications are due to the [University of Chicago Division of Biological Sciences](https://biosciences.uchicago.edu/programs) on December 1, 2021.

<h2>Postdocs</h2>

**All funded postdoc positions in my lab are full at this time.** However, independent postdoctoral fellows are always welcome, and I am happy to advise any interested individuals on related fellowship or grant applications. I have previous experience as both a [Miller Fellow](http://miller.berkeley.edu/) and a [Branco Weiss Fellow](https://brancoweissfellowship.org/) myself and would be delighted to help strategize an application. The [University of Chicago Fellows](https://biologicalsciences.uchicago.edu/research/chicago-fellows) program in the Biological Sciences (applications due annually in December) is one exciting opportunity specific to our university. Please feel free to reach out at [cbrook@uchicago.edu](cbrook@uchicago.edu) if you are interested in developing a fellowship application to join the group.

<h2>Field Technicians</h2>

In part with Ekipa Fanihy, I periodically hire **Field Technicians** (usually American post-bac students; see [People](/people)) to work with Malagasy graduate students catching and collecting samples from wild fruit bats in Madagascar. I have found this to be rewarding opportunity for both parties to engage in scientific and cultural exchange. Applications are now past due for positions beginning in January 2022. Please check back next year for new opportunities and additional hires!
