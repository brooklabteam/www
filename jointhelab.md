#### **PhD Positions**

I will be starting as an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Ecology and Evolution](https://ecologyandevolution.uchicago.edu/) at the University of Chicago in summer 2021. **Applications to join my new lab in autumn 2021 are now past due**. Please check back in late summer/early fall 2021 if you are interested in applying to start in 2022. I'm looking for motivated students with broad interests in disease ecology, conservation biology, and/or epidemiology who are eager to undertake a multi-faceted PhD involving some combination of field study, molecular work, and dynamical modeling. If interested, please don't hesitate to reach out!

#### **Postdocs**

**All funded postdoc positions in my lab are full at this time.** However, independent postdoctoral fellows are always welcome, and I am happy to advise any interested individuals on related fellowship or grant applications. I have previous experience as both a [Miller Fellow](http://miller.berkeley.edu/) and a [Branco Weiss Fellow](https://brancoweissfellowship.org/) myself and would be delighted to help strategize an application.

#### **Field Technicians**

In part with Ekipa Fanihy, I periodically hire **Field Technicians** (usually American post-bac students; see [Team](/team)) to work with Malagasy graduate students catching and collecting samples from wild fruit bats in Madagascar. I have found this to be rewarding opportunity for both parties to engage in scientific and cultural exhange. Field tech positions are currently on hold due to COVID-19, but **I am happy to announce that I will be hiring new field techs to start in January 2022**. I will advertise these positions formally in early February 2021. Please check back at that time for an application. In the meantime, please feel free to contact me with any questions!
