### **Lab Values and Expectations**

---

**We are an equal-opportunity group, committed to enacting anti-racist and anti-sexist policies to promote inclusivity in our lab, the biological sciences, and the academy. We believe that black lives matter, women’s rights are human rights, and no life is illegal. Laboratory members hail from a variety of backgrounds, including underrepresented ethnicities, genders, sexual orientations, and lifestyles. We value and applaud our differences, which we view as our strengths, and we do not tolerate intolerance expressed in any form.**

We believe that open policies and expectations promote a more equitable and inclusive laboratory environment. This "Lab Values and Expectations" is a living document designed to provide guidelines for conduct for the PI, postdocs, PhD students, lab managers, and collaborators who make up the Brook Lab.

#### **Lab Meetings**
---

A weekly hour-long lab meeting forms the core of our laboratory culture. We hold these meetings as video conferences to facilitate equal partnership with our colleagues who are not based in Chicago, most particularly those who are based in Madagascar. We set the calendar for lab meeting on a quarterly basis, with different lab members taking turns leading each session. We open each quarter with a lab meeting dedicated to discussions and readings surrounding issues related to Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI).

After our inaugural DEI meeting, we alternate between weeks focused on "Research Updates" and "Science Lessons". "Research Updates" are informal presentations designed to solicit feedback from the rest of the lab about work-in-progress (data analysis, project design, grant/proposal/paper writing). 

"Science Lessons" are more flexible: we ask only that you teach us all something new. This can take the form of a journal club, a review of a particular area of the literature, a tutorial on a useful tool, or a facilitated discussion of relevant science or science-related news.

You should expect, on average, to lead ~two lab meetings per quarter, one "Research Update" and one "Science Lesson". We are also always available for impromptu meetings if a lab member needs to practice a talk or receive quick feedback on a pience of work.

---
#### **Individual Meetings**
---

Students, postdocs, and lab managers who make up the University of Chicago contingent of the lab are expected to attend weekly, half-hour meetings with Cara. These can take place in person or digitally, as you choose, and the timing for these meetings will be set at the begining of every quarer. The agenda is yours during this time--we can discuss ongoing work, future plans, or anything else you may need. It is also fine to check in to say that there is nothing you need to talk about on a given week. I am also available to meet in impromptu settings at other times during the week for both University of Chicago and University of Antananrivo members of the lab--please don't be shy to ask!

#### **Funding and Support**
---

Funding is rarely discussed openly in academic settings but is generally a critical component of scientific research. I am trying to make this a more open dialogue in the Brook Lab. Explicit funding policies are as follows:

##### Salary
If you are a University of Chicago postdoc or technician or a University of Antananarivo PhD student, your salary is covered by the lab for the duration of your contract and subject to renewal on an annual basis. If you are a University of Chicago PhD student, you are funded through a combination of departmental funds, training grants, personal fellowships, and grant money from the lab. I expect and encourage all PhD students and postdocs to pursue fellowship opportunities, as grant writing is good practice, and fellowships are prestigious additions to a CV.

##### Research Funding
It is the duty of the PI to support student and postdoc research interests financially. I will work to raise money for projects you have proposed, and I will fund publication fees on your work, though I ask that you seek fee reductions or waivers when possible. I also encourage students and postdocs to apply for small grants, as these are great opportunities to fine-tune your research questions, while also boosting your resumé. A list of small grants with links to websites can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1z9SNPZm1uGCIqnq5D3jXC35xzpPvCV_VKG3qQ-TEO0I/edit?usp=sharing) -- please add as you find other opportunities.

##### Personal Development and Personal Equipment
University of Chicago and University of Antananarivo PhD students working in the Brook lab will have the opportunity to purchase one computer for personal research use during their tenure in the lab--this can be acquired immediately upon entering the lab or at a later date, as each person sees fit. The exact specifications of the machine will be worked out on a case-by-case basis between the student and the PI.

Postdocs and lab technicians or managers will also have the opportunity to acquire a computer for use, though I ask that these remain with the lab after the postdoc or technician departs. Please reach out if you are in need of a machine for your work. If you prefer to use your own device, that is perfectly acceptable and can be subsidized with your personal development funds.

Each lab member, both from the University of Chicago and the University of Antananarivo, will have access to $200 annually for personal development (monitors, headphones, books, workshops, etc.). In general, these funds will not rollover from year-to-year. However, if you are interested in compiling funds across multiple years for a specific purpose, this can be arranged upon request.

---
#### **Conference Travel**
---

University of Chicago PhD students, postdocs, and technicians will be funded to attend one domestic conference annually per person (conference fees, travel, lodging). I encourage attendance at the annual Ecology and Evolution of Infectious Diseases (EEID) meeting, which I almost always attend, though I recognize this may not be the best academic fit for everyone. Lab members interested in attending more than one conference annually are encouraged to apply for travel grants or use personal development funds. On rare occasions, I will consider fudning multiple meetings in the same year with justification.

---
#### **Working Hours and Remote Work**
---

Lifestyle freedom is one of the great perks of being an academic, and I do not police strict hours in the lab. I often work odd hours or from various locations (home, cafés, library, etc.) myself, and I trust you to do the same. Research is project-based work, and some weeks are long and intense while others less so. I expect you to work hard but also value work-life balance and maintaining health and sanity, so please do not burn yourself out.

You are entitled to 4 weeks of vacation per year per university policy. You can allocate this as you see fit but I ask that you keep me informed of your plans. For my own part, I often take this as: a week off around the holidays, two weeks off in the summer, and a smattering of long weekends interspersed throughout the year.

Due to our cross-continental extent, the Brook Lab has many policies in place that support remote work. That said, University of Chicago PhD students will need to live in Chicago to attend courses and participate in departmental and lab activities. University of Chicago postdocs are also expected to be on site, unless a remote residence is negotiated with Cara. In the event of the latter, I will fund travel (flight only) to Chicago once per quarter for those based domestically and once per year for those based internationally. 

University of Antananarivo PhD students will be funded to train at the University of Chicago for a minimum of one four week session during the course of their PhD research. These trainings will require significant advance planning and flexibility with timing on the part of the student.

#### **Computing Tools**
---

Code and data for all projects in the lab must be uploaded to a project folder on our  [Brook Lab GitHub platform](https://github.com/brooklabteam), where we also store composite datasets available for any lab member to use following clearance from Cara. It is my expectation that you add your work to this platform as well.

Additionally, we also communicate regularly and share progress on [Slack](https://slack.com/).
