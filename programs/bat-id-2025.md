Bats are the recognized reservoir host of several of the world's most high profile emerging zoonotic diseases; yet they appear not to experience substantial disease from infections that cause high pathology in other mammals. This **4th Triennial BatID 2025** meeting brings together an interdisciplinary array of virologists, immunologists, geneticists, ecologists, and evolutionary biologists to interrogate the role of bats as pathogen hosts.

#### üè† Lodging

Conference attendees who have not already booked dormitory lodging should book alternative lodging options independently.

There are **three hotels** available in the Hyde Park, Chicago area, which can be accessed easily on foot from the University of Chicago: the [Sophy](https://sophyhotel.com/), the [Hyatt Place Chicago-South](https://www.hyatt.com/hyatt-place/en-US/chizu-hyatt-place-chicago-south-university-medical-center), and the [Study](https://www.thestudyatuniversityofchicago.com).

A variety of other hotel options are available in the Chicago Loop, which can be accessed easily from the University of Chicago via a 20-minute ride on the [Metric Electric](https://ridertools.metrarail.com) lightrail (at the [55th-56th-57th Street stop](https://metra.com/train-lines/stations/55th-56th-57th-street)).

#### ‚úàÔ∏è Travel

Two international airports offer easy metro/lightrail access to the University of Chicago: [O'Hare International Airport (ORD)](https://www.flychicago.com/ohare/home/pages/default.aspx) and [Midway International Airport (MDW)](https://www.flychicago.com/midway/home/pages/default.aspx).

MDW is a little closer to UChicago and therefore our recommendation if you are able to find equivalent flight options to either airport.

**Getting here:** The University of Chicago is easily accessible from both O'Hare (ORD) and Midway International Airports (MDW). You can take the Blue line (ORD) or Orange line (MDW) ["L"](https://www.transitchicago.com/assets/1/6/ctamap_Lsystem.png) to the Loop, then transfer to the [ Metra Electric](https://metra.com/train-lines/me) at Millenium Station. From there, you can take the Metra direct to Hyde Park, getting off at either the [51st/53rd St. Hyde Park stop](https://metra.com/train-lines/stations/51st53rd-st-hyde-park) or the [55th-56th-57th Street stop](https://metra.com/train-lines/stations/55th-56th-57th-street) to walk to your lodging.
