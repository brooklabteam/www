Bats are the recognized reservoir host of several of the world's most high profile emerging zoonotic diseases; yet they appear not to experience substantial disease from infections that cause high pathology in other mammals. This <strong>4th Triennial BatID 2025</strong> meeting brings together an interdisciplinary array of virologists, immunologists, geneticists, ecologists, and evolutionary biologists to interrogate the role of bats as pathogen hosts.

<h2>Scientific Program</h2>

The conference will open with a welcome reception the evening of Wednesday, July 9, 2025, followed by two full day sessions, including scientific talks, a poster session, and a brainstorming session to delineate future research priorities in the field.

<h4>Lodging</h4>
<strong>Dormitory lodging</strong> will be available for all interested attendees and will be reserved concomitant with conference registration. The University of Chicago has not yet posted rates for dormitory lodging for summer 2025, though last year rates for a single room were <$100 per night per person and rates for a double room were <$80 per per per night. We anticipate a similar range for BatID 2025. 

For those not desiring to stya in the dorms, three <strong>hotels</strong> are available in the Hyde park area: the Sophy, the Hyatt, and the Study.

<br>
A variety of other hoteloptions are availeble in the Chicago Loop, which can be accessed easily from the University of Chicago via a 20-minute ride on the Metric Electric lightrail.


<h4>Travel Grants</h4>
A limited number of travel grants will likely be available for young investigators from underserved populations (low- and middle- income countries and/or underrepresented minority backgrounds) to attend this program. <strong>Application details for these travel awards will be posted in early January 2025</strong>.
