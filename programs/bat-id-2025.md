Bats are the recognized reservoir host of several of the world's most high profile emerging zoonotic diseases; yet they appear not to experience substantial disease from infections that cause high pathology in other mammals. This <strong>4th Triennial BatID 2025</strong> meeting brings together an interdisciplinary array of virologists, immunologists, geneticists, ecologists, and evolutionary biologists to interrogate the role of bats as pathogen hosts.

<strong>April 30, 2025</strong>: Registration closes for BatID 2025<br />
<br />
<em>Registration fees will be the same as for BatID 2022:</em>

<li>Postdocs: $200</li>
<li>Graduate students: $150</li>
</ul>

<h5>&#127968; Lodging </h5>

<strong>Dormitory lodging</strong> will be available for all interested attendees and will be reserved concomitant with conference registration. The University of Chicago has not yet posted rates for dormitory lodging for summer 2025, though last year rates for a single room were <$100 per night per person and rates for a double room were <$80 per per per night. We anticipate a similar range for BatID 2025. 

For those not desiring to lodge in the dorms, registrants can book other options independently.

There are <strong>three hotels</strong> available in the Hyde Park, Chicago area, which can be accessed esily on foot from the University of Chicago: the <a href="https://sophyhotel.com/">Sophy</a>, the <a href="https://www.hyatt.com/hyatt-place/en-US/chizu-hyatt-place-chicago-south-university-medical-center">Hyatt Place Chicago-South</a>, and the <a href="https://www.thestudyatuniversityofchicago.com">Study</a>.

A variety of other hotel options are available in the Chicago Loop, which can be accessed easily from the University of Chicago via a 20-minute ride on the <a href="https://ridertools.metrarail.com">Metric Electric</a> lightrail (at the <a href="https://metra.com/train-lines/stations/55th-56th-57th-street">55th-56th-57th Street stop</a>).

<h5> &#9992; Travel</h5>
Two international airports offer easy metro/lightrail access to the University of Chicago: <a href="https://www.flychicago.com/ohare/home/pages/default.aspx">O'Hare International Airport (ORD)</a> and <a href="https://www.flychicago.com/midway/home/pages/default.aspx">Midway International Airport (MDW)</a>.
<br>
<br>
MDW is a little closer to UChicago and therefore our recommendation if you are able to find equivalent flight options to either airport.
<br>
<br>
A limited number of <strong>travel grants</strong> will likely be available for young investigators from underserved populations (low- and middle- income countries and/or underrepresented minority backgrounds) to attend this program. <strong>Application details for these travel awards will be posted in early January 2025</strong>.
