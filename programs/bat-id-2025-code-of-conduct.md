# Code Of Conduct

<strong>This is a living policy, subject to continual refinement and expansion. Last updated February 22, 2025.</strong>

Everyone participating in BatID 2025 is required to agree to the following Code of Conduct. This includes all attendees, speakers, performers, patrons (sponsors), volunteers, and staff.

Anyone who violates our Code of Conduct may be removed from these spaces at the discretion of the BatID 2025 Organizing Committee.

If you have questions about this policy, or suggestions for ways it might be improved, please contact us at [batid2025@brooklab.org](mailto:batid2025@brooklab.org).

BatID 2025 is committed to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neurotype, physical appearance, body, age, race, ethnicity, nationality, language, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.

## Definitions

Our definition of “harassment” includes but is not limited to:
- Offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neurotype, physical appearance, body, age, race, ethnicity, nationality, language, or religion
- Unwelcome comments regarding a person’s lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, drugs, and employment
- Physical contact without consent or after a request to stop
- Threats of violence
- Deliberate intimidation
- Stalking or following
- Sustained disruption of discussion
- Unwelcome sexual attention

## Consequences

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, BatID 2025 may take any action we deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion from all BatID 2025 spaces, and restriction from attending future meetings of the society.
